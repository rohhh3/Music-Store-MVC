# Music Store
Web app with basic functionality made for uni IT project.
Project's functionality:
1. Add and remove product from shopping cart
2. Place an order and send it to SQL database
3. Order form
4. Simple-structured  categories of products
5. HTML description of a product
6. Fully working registration and login form
7. Displays items of the week on main page
8. Simple search based on the given keywords
9. Store visits counter
10. Contact form
11. Generation of a product price list in PDF format for a selected category
12. Multicurrency (for now PLN and USD only)
# TODO list for future
1. Restructure the whole category tree - for simplicity, a product can be assigned only to one category, which is not a real-life scenario.
2. Make an admin panel - there's no interactive panel where admin could perform CRUD operations. The database is only being seeded in a file.
3. Database improvements - there are bunch of weird solutions associated with linking individual tables (e.g., no connection between users and their addresses)
4. More database improvements - sending an old price instead of sale price, US currency info is not being sent even if client chose to do so, and many more issues.
5. Currency - displayed currency is only... being displayed and nothing more.
6. Types of shipping and payment implementation
7. Website and PDF generated file styling improvements
